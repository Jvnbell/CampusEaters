# Campus Food Delivery Robot

## Overview
This project aims to develop an autonomous food delivery robot to assist University of Tampa students—particularly those with mobility challenges—by delivering meals from dining halls directly to dorms. The solution integrates **hardware** (motors, sensors, chassis, food compartment) and **software** (navigation algorithms, database, web ordering system) to create a seamless and inclusive food delivery system.  

Our long-term goal is to demonstrate how robotics can improve **accessibility, independence, and convenience** at UTampa and college campuses at large.

## Features (Planned)
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Robot follows pre-defined routes and avoids obstacles using onboard sensors.  
- **Secure Food Compartment**: Lockable container to safely carry meals (up to ~5 lbs).  
- **Web Ordering System**: Students place delivery requests through a simple website.  
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time status updates (in development).  
- **Recipient Authentication**: PIN/QR-based unlocking system for secure delivery (future work).

## Sprint Roadmap

### Semester 1
- **Sprint 1**: Assemble chassis, wire motors, set up manual control, scaffold backend & website.  
- **Sprint 2**: Implement basic navigation (line-following / waypoint system), database setup, order placement MVP.  
- **Sprint 3**: Prototype food compartment, short autonomous test route, simple order status updates.  

### Semester 2
- **More to come**.

## Tech Stack
**Hardware**
- Chassis (6WD off-road robot kit or equivalent)
- Motors + drivers (12V DC, geared for torque)
- LIDAR for obstacle detection
- Raspberry Pi / Arduino for control
- Secure container (custom-built)

**Software**
- Backend: Node.js / Express (API for orders)
- Frontend: React (student order interface)
- Database: MongoDB
- Robot Control: Python (navigation, hardware integration)
- Communication: Wi-Fi for orders & status updates
